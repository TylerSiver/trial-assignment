# Trial Assignment Exercise

To ensure that you will be able to accept assignments and submit them, you are asked to submit this fake assignment as a trial for assignmenet one.

## Your Task
1. Log into your personal GitHub account (so that it can be linked to GitHub Classroom).
2. Accept this assignment and click the button to link your account. This is only done once, so if you linked your account during the demo in class, that is already done.
3. Check out the assignment by cloning it to your local computer.
4. Add an index.html (with a little content, maybe a heading), a CSS folder, and a CSS file with at least one style written in it.
5. Add your changes to the staging area and ensure that the working tree is clean.
6. Make a commit.
7. Push that commit back up to GitHub classroom.

If you need help refer to the GitHub notes on Moodle. 

**Please have this completed before Wednesdays class.**
